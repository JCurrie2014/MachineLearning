This project examines the efforts of 6 individuals performing bar bell lift exercises. The goal is to build a model that interprets accelerometer data and predicts qualitive measures of how each lift was performed. 

All of the code required to duplicate my finding are held in the MLExercise.Rmd file (this repository). It shows that the randomForest model created the most accurate fit for the data, resulting in a 99.27% accuracy rate with a 95% confidence interval of (0.9899, 0.9949).

There is also an html document named MLExercise.html containing the charts and figures. This file contains html source code which needs to be copied and saved to the local system (in a text document saved with the .html extension) in order to be viewed.  

The original data was collected here:
